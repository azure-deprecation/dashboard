Trying to keep up with deprecation of Azure services & features? Don't worry, we've got this!

We provide a dashboard with deprecation notices concerning Microsoft Azure services, data centers _(aka region)_, APIs and SDKs.
Every notice is annotated with the impact, what services are affected and what area.

You can follow us on Twitter [@AzureEndOfLife](https://twitter.com/azureendoflife) or check [our newsletter archive](https://us2.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=bab91a77fe7f2afd181cb4808&id=b0f0db5931).
